## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m GermÃ¡n: engineer, security leader and product lead.

Iâ€™m on a mission to transform how organizations approach Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). My philosophy is simple:

> Security should be built like software, delivered like a product, and adopted like a platform.

## ðŸ”§ What Iâ€™m Working On
Iâ€™m building a new approach to GRC that brings automation, engineering, and product thinking to the heart of security.

## ðŸ§© Interests
* Security as Product
* Security Controls-as-Code
* GRC Automation & Risk Intelligence
* Developer Experience (DX) for Compliance
* Open Source

## ðŸš€ My Vision
Controls as Code. GRC Engineering. Product Transformation.

Letâ€™s replace checklists with systems, audits with signals, and fear with flow.
